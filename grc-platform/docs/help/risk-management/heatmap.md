# Risk Heatmap

The Risk Heatmap provides a visual representation of your organization's risk landscape, displaying risks by their likelihood and impact on a color-coded grid.

## Overview

The heatmap helps you:
- Visualize risk distribution at a glance
- Identify concentration of high-severity risks
- Compare inherent vs. residual risk
- Track risk movement over time

### Color Coding

| Color | Risk Level | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 🟢 Green | Very Low / Low | Monitor periodically |
| 🟡 Yellow | Medium | Regular review |
| 🟠 Orange | High | Priority attention |
| 🔴 Red | Very High / Critical | Immediate action |

### Numbers
The number in each cell shows how many risks fall into that category.
